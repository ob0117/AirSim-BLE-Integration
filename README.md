# AirSim-BLE-Integration

This project serves as a starter template for research students working with the BL Engine to connect EEG signals (via the Muse headset) to a Unity-based simulation using **Microsoft AirSim**.

It was originally put together as part of an undergraduate research assistantship at the [University of Waterloo Human Optimization Modelling Lab](https://uwaterloo.ca/human-optimization-modelling-lab/).

### Getting Started:
1. Read the [BL Engine Manual](BL%20ENGINE/BL%20Engine%20Manual.pptx) to connect the Muse headset to Unity.
2. Set up [AirSim](https://microsoft.github.io/AirSim/Unity/) in Unity.
3. Follow the steps in [`UnityProject/README.md`](UnityProject/README.md) to launch the simulation.

Once you're set up, you'll be able to control an AirSim vehicle in Unity and view basic, real-time EEG data logged to the screen from the Muse headset.
